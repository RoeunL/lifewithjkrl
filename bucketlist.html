<h2>Bucket List Meaning: What’s the Definition and What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    Eat croissants in Paris, snack on bugs, learn to cook Greek food, see the Northern Lights, ride a mechanical bull or bungee jump?<br>
    Most of us have goals and aspirations, things we have always dreamed of doing or hope we could experience in our lifetimes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, many of us already have a mental bucket list, just without the formal label. But, what is the true bucket list meaning?<br>
    How do we define it? Let’s get to the bottom of it.

<h2>Bucket List Meaning</h2>
  <p>
    What is a bucket list? Simply put, it is a collection of goals, dreams and aspirations that you would like to accomplish<br>
    within your lifetime. The basic meaning of a bucket list is to keep track of your goals and to take steps to achieving these goals<br>
    in order to maximize the incredible experiences in your life.
  </p>
<h2>Definition from Dictionary.com:</h2>
  <p>
    BUCK·ET LIST NOUN, INFORMAL.
    1. A LIST OF THINGS A PERSON WANTS TO ACHIEVE OR EXPERIENCE, AS BEFORE REACHING A CERTAIN AGE OR DYING: A BUCKET LIST FOR A TERMINALLY ILL PATIENT.

<h2>Bucket List Origin</h2>
  <p>
    There is some controversy over where the term bucket list actually originated. It definitely gained popularity after<br>
    The Bucket List movie with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman was released in 2007. But, there is evidence that the term was<br>
    used before that time (and I definitely had my bucket list years before the film’s release date).The most common explanation<br>
    for the origin is from the phrase “kick the bucket” which is believed to originate sometime in the Middle Ages when execution by<br>
    hanging was common and the executioner would “kick the bucket”. You get the idea.

<h2>What Goes on a Bucket list?</h2>
  <p>
    There is no right or wrong way of designing a bucket list, no one specific prescription. It is a personal journey between you and<br>
    your aspirations. Each one should be different because it is meant to reflect what you most desire in your own life. For example,<br>
    mine includes learning to surf, skydiving, and rappelling down a waterfall to appease my adventurous side. If you are not a thrill seeker,<br>
    your list may be entirely different.
  </p>
  <p>
    The important part is to come up with items that are meaningful to you; ones that will inspire you to wake up each morning with a fire in your belly.<br>
    Retiling the bathroom floor has no place on this list, nor does cleaning the cobwebs out of the garage. Save those for your weekly honey-dos.<br>
    With that said, don’t worry if you didn’t make each aspiration earth shattering, or even travel related; sometimes the simplest goals are the most rewarding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giving a blood donation took less than an hour commitment, yet is still one of my most gratifying experiences. Also, don’t exclude anything just because<br>
    you think it is too difficult or frightening; it is meant to stretch your comfort zone. Do the same for the things you think are too simple. As long as it has<br>
    meaning to you it should be on your list, because even the smallest achievement can give us the feeling of a great accomplishment.
